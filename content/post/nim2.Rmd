## It's time for some (combinatorial) game theory

In a [previous post](/2017/08/04/implementing-nim-in-r) we wrote a program that 
allows you to play a game of Nim against another human opponent.  In this post
we will show how we can modify our initial program to also allow for play 
against a computer-opponent. To understand how this is possible, however, we 
must first discuss a bit of algebra.

As mentioned in the previous post, the game of Nim gives rise to a special type 
of numbers called, naturally, "nimbers". These numbers look similar to regular
integers, but they are added together by performing a bitwise xor operation on
their binary representations. So how does this work?

Consider the numbers 4 and 7. In binary, these would be represented as 100 and
111, respectively. The xor operator takes two bits (0s or 1s) as input and
returns a 1 if exactly one of the two inputs are 1, and otherwise returns 0. 

For example:

```{r}
xor(0,0)
xor(0,1)
xor(1,0)
xor(1,1)
```

To perform the bitwise xor operation on two numbers, therefore, means we
take two numbers, convert them to binary, line them up, and perform the xor
operation on each consecutive pair of bits. In the case of 4 and 7 we thus get:

```{r bits}
head(intToBits(4))
head(intToBits(7))
head(intToBits(bitwXor(4, 7)))
```

(R gives the binary representation from left to right, so e.g. 4 = 001 here.
We're also wrapping everything in `head` to avoid printing out a ton of zeros).
So the `bitwXor` first looks at 0 and 1 and evaluates to 1, then 1 and 0 gives 1
again, and finally 1 and 1 gives 0. So `bitwXor(4,7)` = 110 (in binary) = 3 (in
decimal).

We said earlier that bitwise xor is how you add together two nimbers, so it
would be convenient if we could use standard notation and just write $4 + 7 =
3$. Luckily, R's beautifully minimalist S3 system is perfectly suited for this.
(Btw, [Thomas Mailund's](https://twitter.com/thomasmailund) [Advanced
Object-oriented Programming in R](http://amzn.to/2vj3mVV) is, in my view, the
most accessible and comprehensive introduction to S3.)

(By taking this approach we're actually severely over-engineering the solution,
but it's a good excuse to play around with S3.)

We start by defining a constructor function, which simply tags a number as a
nimber:

```{r nimbers}
nimber <- function(x) {
  structure(x, class = c("nimber", class(x)))
}

nimber(5)
```

We then implement a pretty-printing method (the `unclass` call here is necessary
to avoid infinite recursive calls to `print`.):

```{r}
print.nimber <- function(x) {
  cat("Nimbers:\n")
  print(unclass(x))
}

nimber(1:5)
```

With that out of the way, we can now overload the `+` operator so that nimber
addition is defined as bitwise xor:

```{r}
`+.nimber` <- function(e1, e2) {
  nimber(bitwXor(e1, e2))
}

nimber(4) + nimber(7)
```

We can also implement a `[` method, so that we can index into a vector of
nimbers without those nimbers being converted into numbers:

```{r}
nimber(1:5)[3]

`[.nimber` <- function(x, i) {
  nimber(NextMethod())
}

nimber(1:5)[3]
```

Finally, we would like to be able to take sum of a vector of nimbers. We
implement the `sum` method using `purrr::reduce`:

```{r}
library(purrr)

sum.nimber <- function(x, na.rm = TRUE) {
  reduce(x, `+`, .init = nimber(0))
}

sum(nimber(c(4, 7)))
sum(nimber(1:5))
```

The mathematically-inclined reader might wonder if this is a legitimate way to
sum a set of nimbers. Indeed it is; bitwise xor is associative with 0 as the
identity element. In fact, every nimber is its own inverse (e.g. 100101 bitwised
xor'ed with itself will produce 000000 = 0, the identity element) and the order
in which we perform the operation is irrelevant. Hence, the nimbers actually
form an abelian group under nim-addition. To be even more precise, since every
element except the identity is of order 2, they form a
[Boolean group](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition%3aBoolean_Group).

So what does all of this have to do with a computer playing Nim? Well, it turns
out that if we treat the number of pebbles in a Nim heap as a nimber, then any
game board can be represented by the nim sum of all the heaps. This sum will
then either be zero or non-zero, and a player can always make a move that takes
a non-zero-sum board and produces a zero-sum board. The key insight from the
mathematical analysis of Nim is that the optimal move is always to produce a
zero-sum board. (We omit all proofs and details here. See the
[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#Mathematical_theory) for
some quite accessible proofs and examples).

So we can define an `optimal_move` function, which takes a board as input,
calculates the nim sum of the board, randomly selects a row among the rows that
have a certain desired property, removes the number of pebbles necessary to
produce a zero-sum board, and returns the optimal move:

```{r optimal_move}
resample <- function(x, ...) {
  x[sample.int(length(x), ...)]
}

optimal_move <- function(board) {
  board_sum <- sum(board)
  row <- resample(which(board + board_sum < board), 1)
  num <- board[row] - (board[row] + board_sum)
  c("row" = row, "num" = num)
}
```

(`resample` is just a more stable version of `sample`). Below, we make sure that
the board is always of class `nimber`, so that the `sum` call gets dispatched to
`sum.nimber`.

If a player is presented with a zero-sum board, however, any move will produce a
non-zero-sum board. For this situation, we will let the computer play a random
move:

```{r}
random_move <- function(board) {
  row <- resample(seq_along(board[board != 0]), 1)
  num <- resample(range(1, board[row]), 1)
  c("row" = row, "num" = num)
}
```

Finally, we wrap these two strategies into a function that takes a board as
input, checks the nim-sum of the board, and chooses the appropriate strategy:

```{r}
computer_move <- function(board) {
  board_sum <- sum(board)
  when(board_sum,
       . == 0 ~ random_move(board),
       . != 0 ~ optimal_move(board))
}
```

(yes, for the optimal move case we're unnecessarily calculating the board-sum
twice, but we'll ignore that for didactic purposes.)

Thanks to the way we originally structured the game, refactoring the `nim` 
function to allow for a computer opponent is now straightforward. We just have
to add a `comp_opponent` argument, make sure that the board is always of class 
`nimber`, and generate a computer move if it's the computer's turn to move:

```{r game_w_computer_moves}
# These remain unchanged
next_player <- function(player) if(player == 1) 2 else 1
valid_move  <- function(board, row, num) num > 0 && board[row] >= num
finished    <- function(board) all(board == 0)
update      <- function(board, row, num) `[<-`(board, row, board[row] - num)
disp_row    <- function(row, num) cat(row, ":", rep("*", num), "\n")
disp_board  <- function(board) walk2(seq_along(board), board, disp_row)
get_move    <- function() {
  row <- as.integer(readline("Choose a row: "))
  num <- as.integer(readline("Number of stars to remove: "))
  c("row" = row, "num" = num)
}

nim <- function(board = 5:1, player = 1, comp_opponent = TRUE) {
  if(!inherits(board, "nimber")) {
    board <- nimber(board)
  }

  if(finished(board)) {
    cat("Game over. Player", next_player(player), "wins!")
    return(invisible())
  }

  disp_board(board)
  cat("Player", player, "\n")
  play <- if(player == 2 && comp_opponent)
    computer_move(board)
  else get_move()

  row  <- play["row"]
  num  <- play["num"]

  if(!valid_move(board, row, num)) {
    cat("Not a valid move. Try again.\n")
    nim(board, player)
  } else nim(update(board, row, num), next_player(player))
}
```

An interesting extension would be to add a `difficulty` parameter to `nim`, 
which would allow a player to specify how often the computer plays the optimal
move. We'll leave this as an exercise (hint: `runif` will probably be your
friend here).
