Consider a number, say 4. If we want to multiply this number by itself 3 times
we can write this as either $4 \times 4 \times 4$, or, more compactly, as $4^3$.
This operation is known as *exponentiation* and follows some well-known
algebraic laws and conventions. For example, for any non-zero number $x$ we
have:

* $x^k = \overbrace{x \times x \times \dots \times x}^{k \text{ times}}$
* $x^1 = x$
* $x^0 = 1$
* $x^{-1} = \frac{1}{x}$
* $x^{-k} = (\frac{1}{x})^{k}$

This is all surely familiar to the reader. What may not be directly obvious,
however, is that we can meaningfully define analogous operations on invertible
matrices and use the same notation:

* $A^k = \overbrace{AA \dots A}^{k \text{ times}}$: Exponentiation by positive
integer is repeated multiplication.
* $A^1 = A$: Exponentiation by identity returns original matrix.
* $A^0 = I$: Exponentiation by zero returns the identity matrix.
* $A^{-1} = \text{inv}(A)$: Exponentiation by -1 returns inverse of original matrix.
* $A^{-k} = \text{inv}(A)^k$: Exponentiation by negative integer is repeated
multiplication of inverse.

R does not have built-in support for these operations (e.g. for a matrix `A`, 
`A^2` does not multiply `A` by itself, but rather squares every entry of `A`).
In this post, therefore, we will implement this functionality. In doing so, we
will touch on a number of topics:

* Defining test cases to make clear exactly what goal we're trying to achieve,
and test if our proposed solution achieves that goal
* Higher-order functions
* Using `purrr::reduce` to avoid loops
* Diagonalizing a matrix (which involves an eigendecomposition)
* Computational complexity
* Benchmarking code

## Defining test cases

```{r opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

We start by loading some necessary packages.

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(assertthat)
library(microbenchmark)
```

Next, we define a sample $3 \times 3$ matrix that we use throughout the post.

```{r sample_matrix}
set.seed(1)
n <- 3
(A <- matrix(sample(10, n ^ 2, TRUE), n, n))
```

We now define a function `test_properties` that takes as input a matrix `A` and
a function `f` that takes powers of that matrix. It then applies `f` to `A` for
various exponents and checks if it gives the desired result. For example, for
any implementation of a power function `f` we would expect that f(A, 0) (i.e.
$A$ raised to the zero power) would return the identity matrix (i.e. `diag(1,
nrow(A))`).

```{r test_properties}
test_properties <- function(f, A) {
  list(
    "A^4 == AAAA"      = are_equal(f(A,  4), A %*% A %*% A %*% A),
    "A^1 == A"         = are_equal(f(A,  1), A),  
    "A^0 == I"         = are_equal(f(A,  0), diag(1, nrow(A))),
    "A^-1 == inv(A)"   = are_equal(f(A, -1), solve(A)),
    "A^-4 == inv(A)^4" = are_equal(f(A, -4), solve(A) %^% 4)
  )
}
```

Since `test_properties` is a function that takes another function as input, we
would call this a *higher-order function* (or a *functional* to be more
precise).

## Strategy 1: Naive repeated multiplication

We can try out `test_properties` on a trivial implementation of a power
function. (If the reader is unfamiliar with the percentage sign-notation, that
is how we define infix functions in R).

```{r trivial}
`%^%` <- function(A, k) {
  A
}
```

So `%^%` takes an `A` and a `k` as input, throws away the `k` and returns the
`A` unchanged. Let's see what tests it passes.

```{r test_trivial}
str(test_properties(`%^%`, A))
```

In order to pass all the other tests we need an implementation that actually
does something. The next implementation starts by defining the identity matrix
`I` of the same dimensions as `A` and initializes the matrix `Ak` to be this
matrix (this is a bit roundabout, but useful for didactic purposes). It then
enters a `while`-loop that decrements `k` while multiplying `Ak` by `A`. Once
`k` hits zero, it returns the final matrix.

```{r loop}
`%^%` <- function(A, k) {
  I <- diag(1, nrow(A))
  Ak <- I
  while(k > 0) {
    Ak <- Ak %*% A
    k <- k - 1
  }
  Ak
}

A %*% A
A %^% 2
```

Let's see if this implementation is any better.

```{r test_loop}
str(test_properties(`%^%`, A))
```

Ok, so it works for positive, but not negative, exponents. Let's fix that.

```{r loop2}
`%^%` <- function(A, k) {
  I <- diag(1, nrow(A))
  if(k < 0) {
    A <- solve(A)
    k <- k * -1
  }
  Ak <- I
  while(k > 0) {
    Ak <- Ak %*% A
    k <- k - 1
  }
  Ak
}
```

Here we just check if `k` is negative, and if it is, replace `A` with its
inverse. Everything else remains unchanged.

```{r test_loop2}
str(test_properties(`%^%`, A))
```

It now passes all tests. Beautiful. As good functional programmers, however, we
feel a bit queasy about using loops, so let's use `purrr::reduce` to get rid of
it.

```{r reduce}
`%^%` <- function(A, k) {
  I <- diag(1, nrow(A))
  if(k < 0) {
    A <- solve(A)
    k <- k * -1
  }
  reduce(seq_len(k), ~. %*% A, .init = I)
}
```

The first part here is identical to the earlier function, but instead of the
`while` loop we call `reduce` on a dummy vector of length `k` with the identity
matrix as the starting value. The machinery of `reduce` then takes care of all
the details of accumulating the matrix products.

```{r test_reduce}
str(test_properties(`%^%`, A))
```

Indeed, the implementation with `reduce` also passes our test cases.

If we stop to consider how this appropach scales with larger inputs of `k`,
however, we notice that we always need to do exactly `k` matrix multiplications.
So the growth rate is linear in `k`. Since matrix multiplication itself is very
computationally demanding -- between $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n^{2.373})$ depending on the algorithm -- this approach will only
work for fairly small matrices and small values of `k`. Fortunately, there's a
very clever approach that involves diagonalizing `A` which runs in much better
time.

## Strategy 2: Diagonalization  

It's a remarkable fact that under the [right
circumstances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix), a matrix
$A$ can be decomposed as $A = PDP^{-1}$, where the columns of $P$ are the
eigenvectors of $A$ and $D$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of $A$
along the main diagonal.

Consider our matrix `A`. Let's find its eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

```{r eigen}
eigen(A)
```

So $A$ has three eigenvalues (which happen to be complex numbers) and three
associated eigenvectors. If what we said above about the eigendecomposition is
true, we should thus be able to do the following:

```{r eigendecomp}
eig <- eigen(A)
P <- eig$vectors
P_inv <- solve(P)
D <- diag(eig$values)

A
P %*% D %*% P_inv
Re(P %*% D %*% P_inv)
```

So we indeed have $A = PDP^{-1}$ (since the eigenvalues are in $\mathbb{C}$ we
have to coerce them back to $\mathbb{R}$ using the `Re` function).

Now, not all matrices can be decomposed like this and the exact conditions for
when a matrix is diagonalizable is a bit involved (we would have to figure out
both the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue, and check if
they are all equal). However, there is a sufficient (but not necessary)
condition for diagonalizability, viz. that an $n \times n$ matrix is always
diagonalizable if it has $n$ distinct eigenvalues. So checking for this
condition should deal with most situations. (We will ignore issues of numeric
stability).

But how does all this help us with the problem of taking powers of a matrix?

Observe:

$$
A^2 = AA = PDP^{-1}PDP^{-1} = PD(P^{-1}P)DP^{-1} = PDIDP^{-1} = PDDP^{-1} = PD^2P^{-1}
$$

More generally, $A^n = PD^nP^{-1}$. And since $D$ is diagonal, we can
get $D^n$ by simply raising the elements on the diagonal of $D$ to $n$, which is
a very cheap operation. No messy repeated matrix multiplication!

Let's write an implementation.

```{r diag}
`%^^%` <- function(A, k) {
  eig <- eigen(A)
  
  # check if A is diagonalizable
  stopifnot(length(unique(eig$values)) == nrow(A))
  
  P <- eig$vectors
  D <- diag(eig$values ^ k)
  Ak <- P %*% D %*% solve(P)
  Re(Ak)
}
```

Let's see if works.

```{r test_diag}
str(test_properties(`%^^%`, A))
```

Let's also check it for some other matrix. Let $B$ be the
rotate-by-90-degrees-counterclockwise matrix. We would then expect $B^4$ to be a
full 360 degree turn, which is equivalent to doing nothing (i.e. the identity
matrix).

```{r rotation_matrix}
(B <- matrix(c(0, 1, -1, 0), 2))
B %^^% 4
```

```{r test_rotation}
str(test_properties(`%^^%`, B))
```

## Comparing the two strategies

We would expect the run time of the first approach to be quite fast for small
values of $k$, since we don't have to do any eigendecomposition, but to grow
more or less linearly as $k$ increases. Conversely, the second approach should
be slow for small values of $k$ since we have to find the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors if even $k$ is very small. But once that decomposition is found,
the magnitude of $k$ should have little effect on how long it takes to compute.

We set up a vector of `k` running from 1 to 200, and for each value we take `A`
to that power. We repeat that 50 times for each value of `k` and record how long
each iteration takes. Finally, we filter out some outliers that otherwise make
the results difficult to visualize.

```{r evaluate}
times <- 1:200 %>%
  map_df(~
        microbenchmark(
          "repeated multiplication" = A %^% .,
          "diagonalization" = A %^^% .,
          times = 50
        ) %>%
        as_data_frame() %>%
        mutate(k = .x)
  ) %>%
  filter(time < quantile(time, .99))
```

To figure out for what value of $k$ the diagonalization approach starts being
superior, we run a simple regression and figure out where the two lines
intersect.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(time ~ k*expr, data = times)

df_intersect <-
  data_frame("expr" = "diagonalization", 
             "k"    = -1 * coef(m1)["exprdiagonalization"] / 
                           coef(m1)["k:exprdiagonalization"]) %>%
  mutate(time = predict(m1, .))

df_intersect
```

The interpretation is that for matrices of this particular size, raising it to a
power less than `r round(df_intersect$k)` is best done with the repeated
multiplication approach, and thereafter by the diagonalization approach.

Finally, we plot the results.

```{r plot}
ggplot(times, aes(x = k, y = time / 1e3, group = expr)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = expr), alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", size = 0.1) +
  geom_point(data = df_intersect) +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("(%0.0f, %0.0f)", k, time)),
            data = df_intersect, 
            vjust = 2, hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = c(1, 0), 
        legend.justification = c(1, 0),
        legend.background = element_rect(color = "grey70")) +
  labs(y = "Time (microseconds)", color = NULL,
       title = "Powers of a matrix",
       subtitle = paste0(
         "Time taken to raise a 3x3 matrix to the", 
         " kth power using different approaches")
       )
```
