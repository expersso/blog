[Maëlle Salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon) has a [new 
post](http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/08/06/p1/) up where she looks at a data set on
guest hosts on a popular Swedish radio show. In the post Maëlle specifically 
asks for constructive criticism on her code, so here are some thoughts.

## Original approach

Maëlle starts by manually downloading an `xlsx` file and converting it to a
`csv`, which she then reads with `readr::read_csv`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# all summer guests
sommargaester <- readr::read_csv("data/p1sommar.csv", col_names = FALSE, 
                                 locale = readr::locale(encoding = "latin1"))
```

To deal with the fact that the names are of the form "Last name, First name",
she then defines a function to split the names, creates a new data frame with
those names, and then left joins that data frame to the original one. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get their names
sommargaester_names <- unique(sommargaester$X1)

# for putting names in the right order for later queries
transform_name <- function(name){
  paste(stringr::str_split(name, ",",
                           simplify = TRUE)[2],
        stringr::str_split(name, ",",
                           simplify = TRUE)[1])
}

pretty_sommargaester_names <- purrr::map_chr(sommargaester_names, transform_name)
sommargaester_names <- tibble::tibble(name = pretty_sommargaester_names,
                                      X1 = sommargaester_names)
sommargaester <- dplyr::left_join(sommargaester, sommargaester_names,
                                  by = "X1")

sommargaester <- dplyr::select(sommargaester, - X1)
```

She then gathers the dates into a single `date` variable and generates a `rep`
variable by grouping on `name`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# transform the date
sommargaester <- tidyr::gather(sommargaester, "rep", "date", X2:X7)
sommargaester <- dplyr::group_by(sommargaester, name)
sommargaester <- dplyr::mutate(sommargaester, rep = 1:n())
sommargaester <- dplyr::ungroup(sommargaester)
```

Finally, she filters out a bunch of unwanted dates, and converts `date` to a
proper format.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sommargaester <- dplyr::filter(sommargaester, !is.na(date))
# remove winter
sommargaester <- dplyr::filter(sommargaester, !stringr::str_detect(date, "V"))
# remove repeat episodes
sommargaester <- dplyr::filter(sommargaester, !stringr::str_detect(date, "R"))


# transform the date to a format with a non ambiguous year
sommargaester <- dplyr::mutate(sommargaester, date = as.numeric(date))
sommargaester <- dplyr::mutate(sommargaester, date = ifelse(date > 180000, paste0("19", date),
                                                            ifelse(date < 100000,
                                                                   paste0("200", date),
                                                                   paste0("20", date))))
sommargaester <- dplyr::mutate(sommargaester, pretty_date = lubridate::ymd(date))
```

## Alternative approach

Here are some thoughts on how one could've done this cleaning in bit 
differently.

To make the process more reproducible we want to avoid having to download and 
convert the `xlsx` file manually. So we define a helper function that takes a
url as input, creates a temporary file, downloads the url, reads it in as a data
frame, and finally unlinks the temporary file.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)

read_xlsx <- function(url) {
  tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")
  on.exit(unlink(tmp))
  download.file(url, tmp, mode = "wb")
  readxl::read_xlsx(tmp, col_names = FALSE)
}
```

A less-than-optimal pattern I often see is when people have a data frame from 
which they derived a second data frame with some additional meta data, which 
they then merge back into the original data frame. This can almost always be 
avoided. I think one should always strive towards keeping all data relevant to a
data frame within that same data frame (this is also why I think people should 
use list-columns more often).

To avoid having to make a second data frame with names, we use `tidyr::separate`
to generate two new variable (`last` and `first`) which we then paste together
into `name`.

Given how the original data set was structured, the names of the date columns
("X__2" etc) actually contains the information for the `rep` variable, so we
can just drop the "X__" part and coerce it to a numeric variable. This avoids
having to group and ungroup on `name`.

Instead of doing two separate filter calls with `str_detect` we can use a
regular expression.

To avoid a lot of the issues with cleaning the dates, we can exploit 
the fact that characters have an order defined on them (e.g. "a" < "b"). So we 
can simply check if the date is greater than "570000" to get all years from 
1957-1999 and then add the "19" prefix to those and "20" to the rest. We then
use 'lubridate::ymd` to convert to a `Date` format.

Finally, we drop an aberrant observation (a date was miscoded and it's not clear
what the correct date would be) and select only the variables we need.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sommargaester <- 
  paste0("http://sverigesradio.se/Diverse/AppData/Isidor/",
         "Files/2071/b5aebbfa-cee4-4733-96f5-10fe96edfa91.xlsx") %>% 
  read_xlsx() %>% 
  separate(X__1, c("last", "first"), ",") %>% 
  mutate(name = paste(first, last)) %>%
  gather(rep, date, starts_with("X")) %>% 
  mutate(rep = as.numeric(str_replace(rep, "X__", ""))) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(date, "[VR]")) %>% 
  mutate(date = if_else(date >= "570000", 
                        paste0("19", date), 
                        paste0("20", date)),
         date = ymd(date)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% 
  select(name, rep, date)
  
head(sommargaester)
```

With these few tricks, we've reduced the cleaning section from 2040 to 871
characters, for a reduction of about 60%, without reducing its readability.
