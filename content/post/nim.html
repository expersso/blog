<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">Nim</a> is a classic of computer science. In this post we will implement an interactive version of Nim in R using a functional style of programming. The implementation will allow the user to play a game against a human opponent in an R console.</p>
<p>In a second post, we will use a bit of object-oriented programming (using R’s S3 system) to implement a quirky algebra called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimber">Nimbers</a>, and show how these can be used to “solve” Nim. With this solution, we can then generalize the game by implementing a computer-opponent playing a perfect strategy.</p>
<p>In a final post, we will wrap this all up as a Shiny app, to do away with the need for an R installation to play the game.</p>
<p>A caveat before we start; Nim is, frankly, not a terribly fun game to play. So the reader shouldn’t be too concerned with the game itself, but rather focus on the functional programming patterns used to implement it.</p>

<h2>How to play Nim</h2>
<p>A game of Nim consists of two players and a certain number of heaps of, say, pebbles. The players take turns choosing a heap and removing one or more pebbles from that heap. The game ends when a player is unable to remove any pebbles (i.e. starts a turn with an empty board). That player has lost the game.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A game starts with three heaps, with 3, 2, and 1 pebble(s) respectively. I start by removing 3 pebbles from the first heap. You then remove one pebble from the second heap. This leaves one pebble in each of heaps two and three. I remove one pebble from heap 3 and you remove the last one from heap 2. I’m now faced with an empty board, and have thus lost the game.</p>

<div id="implementation-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Implementation in R</h2>
<p>We start by loading the <code>purrr</code> package (for the <code>walk2</code> and <code>case</code> functions).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)</code></pre>
<p>We will represent a game board as a simple numeric vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>initial_board &lt;- 3:1
initial_board</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3 2 1</code></pre>
<p>We also want a more appealing way to display a board:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>disp_row   &lt;- function(row, num) {
  cat(row, &quot;:&quot;, rep(&quot;*&quot;, num), &quot;\n&quot;)
}

disp_board &lt;- function(board) {
  walk2(seq_along(board), board, disp_row)
}

disp_board(initial_board)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 1 : * * * 
## 2 : * * 
## 3 : *</code></pre>
<p>Players will be represented simply as the integers 1 and 2, and we can create a utility function for switching between them:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>next_player &lt;- function(player) {
  if(player == 1) 2 else 1
}

next_player(1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>next_player(2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1</code></pre>
<p>The game ends when all heaps are zero:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>finished &lt;- function(board) {
  all(board == 0)
}

finished(initial_board)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>finished(c(0, 0, 0))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>To make a move we simply take as input a board, a row, and a number (of pebbles to remove), subtract the number from the existing number of pebbles in that row and return a new board:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>update &lt;- function(board, row, num) {
  board[row] &lt;- board[row] - num
  board
}

update(initial_board, 1, 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0 2 1</code></pre>
<p>We also need to make sure a player doesn’t try to make an invalid move (i.e. remove no pebbles or more pebbles than are available). Here we also start referring to heaps as rows, since it feels a bit more natural:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>valid_move &lt;- function(board, row, num) {
  num &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; board[row] &gt;= num
}

valid_move(initial_board, 2, 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>valid_move(initial_board, 2, 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need a way to receive input from the player:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_move &lt;- function() {
  row &lt;- as.integer(readline(&quot;Choose a row: &quot;))
  num &lt;- as.integer(readline(&quot;Number of stars to remove: &quot;))
  c(&quot;row&quot; = row, &quot;num&quot; = num)
}</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/nim/get_move.png" />

</div>
<p>We’re now ready to combine together all of these functions into a single function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nim &lt;- function(board = 5:1, player = 1) {
  if(finished(board)) {
    cat(&quot;Game over. Player&quot;, next_player(player), &quot;wins!&quot;)
    return(invisible())
  }

  disp_board(board)
  cat(&quot;Player&quot;, player, &quot;\n&quot;)
  play &lt;- get_move()
  row &lt;- play[&quot;row&quot;]
  num &lt;- play[&quot;num&quot;]

  if(!valid_move(board, row, num)) {
    cat(&quot;Not a valid move. Try again.\n&quot;)
    nim(board, player)
  } else nim(update(board, row, num), next_player(player))
}</code></pre>
<p>So <code>nim</code> takes a board and a player as input. It then starts by checking if the game is finished; if it is, then the other player has won and the game ends. Otherwise, we display the board and the active player and prompt for a move. If the move is invalid we show a warning and recursively restart the turn. If the move is valid, however, we also recurse, but this time with an updated board and new player.</p>
<p>(Recursion is not very natural to R, and often not a good idea. We could easily avoid recursion by wrapping the game in a <code>while</code>-loop instead, but it wouldn’t be quite as elegant. Besides, we would have to play a very large game before becoming concerned with blowing the stack through too many recursive calls.)</p>
<p>Here’s what a game looks like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/nim/nim.gif" />

</div>
<p>In summary, here is the entire game, in less than 30 lines of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>next_player &lt;- function(player) if(player == 1) 2 else 1
valid_move  &lt;- function(board, row, num) num &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; board[row] &gt;= num
finished    &lt;- function(board) all(board == 0)
update      &lt;- function(board, row, num) `[&lt;-`(board, row, board[row] - num)
disp_row    &lt;- function(row, num) cat(row, &quot;:&quot;, rep(&quot;*&quot;, num), &quot;\n&quot;)
disp_board  &lt;- function(board) walk2(seq_along(board), board, disp_row)
get_move    &lt;- function() {
  row &lt;- as.integer(readline(&quot;Choose a row: &quot;))
  num &lt;- as.integer(readline(&quot;Number of stars to remove: &quot;))
  c(&quot;row&quot; = row, &quot;num&quot; = num)
}

nim &lt;- function(board = 5:1, player = 1) {
  if(finished(board)) {
    cat(&quot;Game over. Player&quot;, next_player(player), &quot;wins!&quot;)
    return(invisible())
  }

  disp_board(board)
  cat(&quot;Player&quot;, player, &quot;\n&quot;)
  play &lt;- get_move()
  row &lt;- play[&quot;row&quot;]
  num &lt;- play[&quot;num&quot;]

  if(!valid_move(board, row, num)) {
    cat(&quot;Not a valid move. Try again.\n&quot;)
    nim(board, player)
  } else nim(update(board, row, num), next_player(player))
}</code></pre>
</div>
