## Introduction

In a recent [blog post
](https://www.mango-solutions.com/blog/the-twitter-waterflow-problem), Nathan
Eastwood solved the so-called [Twitter Waterfall
Problem](http://chrisdone.com/posts/twitter-problem-loeb) using R. In his post,
Nathan provides two solutions; one imperative approach using a large for-loop,
and one more substantive approach using `R6`.

This post uses Nathan's first solution as a case study of how to refactor
imperative code using a more functional approach.

## Problem

Consider this picture:

The blocks here represent walls, and we're imagining what would happen if water
were poured onto this structure. All water poured on the sides would run off,
while some water would get trapped in the middle. In effect, it would end up
looking like this:

![](https://www.mango-solutions.com/blog/user/pages/01.blog/130.the-twitter-waterflow-problem/image2-small.png)

So the problem is: given a set of walls, where would water accumulate?

## Imperative solution

The walls are represented by a simple numerical vector `wall`. We then iterate
over these walls from left to right. As Nathan explains,

> the left or right is less than the current height, then I get the run off.

Nathan offers the following solution (which I wrapped inside a function):

```{r original}
wall <- c(2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 7, 6)

get_water_original <- function(wall) {
  len <- length(wall)
  # pre-allocate memory to make the loop more efficient
  water <- rep(0, len)
  for (i in seq_along(wall)) {
    currentHeight <- wall[i]
    maxLeftHeight <- if (i > 1) {
      max(wall[1:(i - 1)])
    } else {
      0
    }
    maxRightHeight <- if (i == len) {
      0
    } else {
      max(wall[(i + 1):len])
    }
    smallestMaxHeight <- min(maxLeftHeight, maxRightHeight)
    water[i] <- if (smallestMaxHeight - currentHeight > 0) {
      smallestMaxHeight - currentHeight
    } else {
      0
    }
  }
  water
}

get_water_original(wall)
```

The function outputs the correct solution, viz. that we would get water columns
of height 4 in position 3, height 3 in position 4, and so on.

## Functional solution

If we look closely at the `for`-loop we see that it really consists of three
separate parts:

1. For a given `i`, find the current height, maximum height to the left, and
maximum height to the right.
1. For a given set of heights, find the minimum of max heights to the left and
the right, and find the difference between that and the current height.
1. Machinery for iterating over the `wall` vector and populating the `water`
vector.

Having thus identified the relevant parts, we should be able to define/reuse
three corresponding functions. We can use `purrr::map` to take care of all the
looping machinery (point 3), so we just need to define functions `get_max` and
`get_depth`.

We first load some packages.

```{r pkgs}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(microbenchmark)
```

Now, `get_max` takes a vector `wall` and an index `i` as input, and starts by
splitting up `wall` into `left`, `right`, and (implicit) `mid` parts. It then
finds the maximum values for each part, and returns a list with the results.

```{r get_max}
get_max <- function(wall, i) {
  left  <- wall[seq_len(i - 1)]
  right <- wall[seq(i + 1, length(wall))]
  list(l = max(left, 0, na.rm = TRUE),
       m = wall[i],
       r = max(right, 0, na.rm = TRUE))
}

get_max(wall, 2)
```

Next, `get_depth` takes a list of heights `h` produced by `get_max` as input and
returns either their least difference, or 0.

```{r get_depth}
get_depth <- function(h) {
  max(min(h$l, h$r) - h$m, 0)
}

get_depth(get_max(wall, 3))
```

For convenience, we can even compose the two functions with `purrr::compose` to
create a function `f` which takes as input a `wall` and an `i` and returns the
depth of water at that position.

```{r compose}
f <- compose(get_depth, get_max)
```

Finally, we let `map_dbl` take care of the looping/iterating for us.

```{r get_water}
get_water <- function(wall) {
  map_dbl(seq_along(wall), f, wall = wall)
}

get_water(wall)
```

## Comparing results

We can test if the two solutions give identical results by generating a large
wall and compare the results.

```{r test_equality}
big_wall <- sample(1:1000, 1000, TRUE)
all(get_water_original(big_wall) == get_water(big_wall))
```

We can also check whether one solution is faster than the other:

```{r benchmark}
microbenchmark(get_water(big_wall), get_water_original(big_wall))
```

Unsurprisingly, the functional solution is somewhat slower, largely owing
(presumably) to its greater number of function calls.

## Plotting results

To plot a solution we first define a function that takes a `wall` as input,
solves the problem, and returns a tidy data frame with all the necessary
information for drawing the walls and water columns.

```{r df_solution}
df_solution <- function(wall) {
  df <- data_frame(
    x = seq_along(wall),
    wall,
    water = get_water(wall)
  )
  gather(df, key, y, -x)
}

df_solution(wall)
```

We can then pass such a data frame into `plot_solution` to draw the walls and
water.

```{r plot_solution, fig.height=2, fig.width=2}
plot_solution <- function(df) {
  ggplot(df, aes(x + 0.5, y, fill = fct_rev(key))) +
    geom_col(position = "stack", show.legend = FALSE, width = 1) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "grey")) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq_along(wall)) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(wall), 1)) +
    theme_void() +
    theme(
      strip.text = element_blank(),
      panel.ontop = TRUE,
      panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = "white", size = 0.1),
      panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "white", size = 0.1),
      plot.margin = unit(rep(0.1, 4), "cm")
    ) +
    coord_equal()
}

plot_solution(df_solution(wall))
```

Finally, we can generate a large number of random walls and plot each solution
as a separate facet.

```{r plots, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3}
walls <- rerun(25, df_solution(sample(1:10, 10, TRUE))) %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "draw")

plot_solution(walls) +
  facet_wrap(~draw) +
  ggtitle("Twitter Waterfall Challenge")
```
